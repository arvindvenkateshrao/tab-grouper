# Tab-Grouper  

## 🚀 What It Does  
**Tab-Grouper** is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you keep your workspace organized by grouping multiple tabs to the right of the current one — all in a single click.  

### Why I made this
Google's tab grouping feature is convienient for organizing tabs in a single window, but there are a couple caveats:
- You have to manually drag each tab into a group
- Inconvienient for organizing multiple related tabs together
- Open to accidentally mixing tabs into groups that you didn't intend to put this into.
So I wanted to create an extension that would automate this process (with some customization) so I could better manage my online class work.

### Key Capabilities
- Group a contiguous block of tabs to the right of the active tab  
- Assign a custom **name** and **color** to the new group  
- Simple popup UI for quick configuration  
- Non-disruptive — only affects tabs to the right of your current tab

✅ Group tabs instantly using Chrome’s built-in tab grouping API  
✅ Choose a group name and color  
✅ Lightweight, privacy-friendly, and easy to use
